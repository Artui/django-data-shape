## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-01

### Added
- The shape vocabulary: `Shape`, `Table`, and the `Skew`, `Uniform`, `Sequential`
  and `Constant` distributions, behind a single-method `Distribution` protocol.
- `build()`, which generates rows, loads them with `COPY FROM STDIN`, moves the
  identity sequence past the keys it assigned, and runs `ANALYZE`. The order is
  owned by the library: loading into a table analyzed while empty leaves the
  planner applying old statistics to a new row count, which is a worse lie than
  having no statistics at all.
- `InvalidShape`, raised at declaration time, and `UnsupportedBackend`, raised
  for any connection that is not PostgreSQL. Generation is backend-neutral;
  `COPY` and planner statistics are not, and degrading quietly would produce the
  false confidence this package exists to remove.
- Primary keys are assigned as a dense `1..N` range rather than declared. That is
  what will let a foreign key be satisfied without a lookup once relations land,
  and what makes a self-referential tree acyclic by construction.
- A field carrying a Django `default=` is filled with the value `save()` would
  have written, because defaults are applied by `save()` and nothing here calls
  it. A callable default is refused instead of guessed: `uuid4` varies per row
  and `dict` does not, and nothing on the field distinguishes them.

- `ShapeNotEmpty`, raised before anything is written when a target table already
  holds rows. Keys start at 1 on every build, so the collision was previously a
  unique-violation naming an index, which says nothing about what to do instead.
- The whole build runs in one transaction, so a shape whose second table fails
  leaves nothing behind and can be re-run after a fix.
- Every declared value passes through its field's `get_db_prep_save`. Without it
  a naive datetime was stored verbatim rather than localised -- hours from where
  `save()` puts it under a non-UTC `TIME_ZONE` -- and a `JSONField` could not be
  written at all.

### Notes
- Relations are refused in both directions: declaring one raises, and so does
  omitting one that cannot be null. An optional foreign key may be omitted and
  loads entirely `NULL`, which is documented rather than left to be discovered.
- Only integer primary keys are supported. Any other kind is refused, rather than
  a dense `1..N` integer range being written into a character column.
- psycopg 3 is required and psycopg 2 is refused by name. Rows stream straight
  into `COPY FROM STDIN`, which psycopg 2 cannot do without materialising them
  first.
